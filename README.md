# Breast-Cancer-Cells-Profiling-and-Classification

After conducting a PCA analysis (R-Studio) on the cells' morphological characteristics, a Logistic regression model (Scikit-learn) is applied to classify the benign/malignant nature of each cells.

1 - Breast Cancer Cells Analysis using PCA
During my Msc. in Data Science, I had the opportunity to analyze, together with my colleague Edoardo Ferrero, digitalised images of breast cancer cells, whose characteristics have been categorised under different measures. Starting from personal intuition, I wanted to analyze how these - seemingly redundant - characteristics could have been dimensionally reduced in order to explain a consistent magnitude of variance with regards to malignant cancer cells. After having filtered the dataset to keep only those cells classified as malignant, we performed a Principal Component Analysis on R Studio, highlighting those features which aggregately contribute to the 82% of the variance in the dataset, potentially underlying the malignant nature of the cancer cell.
